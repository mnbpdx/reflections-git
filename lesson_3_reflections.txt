Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: I'd use a remote repository like GitHub to share my work with others. Perhaps this would
be to showcase my work, make parts of my code available to other users for use in their
projects, or to collaborate with others on my code.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: I may not always be ready to pull changes from a remote repository. I may have code
I'm working on that wouldn't work correctly with changes made in the remote repository.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one
instead of another?

A: A clone is a copy of a repository. You can use the command "clone" to create a clone of
a Github repository on your local system. A branch is a chain of commits within a
repository. A fork is a Github specific copy of a repository within Github, that contains
metadata that traces copies back to the original repository. A fork is used to obtain a
copy of other people's code on Github. Cloning is used to copy a repository on Github 
(or elsewhere) to a local machine. Branching is used to create new independent versions 
of a project within a repository that are different from other branches and your master
branch. You might create a branch for a beta version of a program, etc.
