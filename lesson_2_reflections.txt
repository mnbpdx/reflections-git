Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A: When you initialize a repository, a .git file is created in the directory
you are in. This makes it so files can be added to the repository and we
can implement version control on the directory. No commits are made at the
time of initialization.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

A: You add files from the working directory into the repository as a
commit. The staging area acts as a middle ground before making a commit.
I think this is here to prevent errors, as I think I've heard that commits
can't be undone.
